# Puppy POUND!

**We love the puppies!**

# Create two separate models. One model will belong to the other. Each model should have a minimum of 6 attributes.
# RESTful routes (index/show/edit/etc) for the parent model.
# Views for all of the restful routes (CRUD).
# Controller actions for the restful routes (CRUD).
# Each attribute in your models should have validations.
# Add bootstrap to your app! Try adding a basic navbar and some basic styling with the grid system.

1 Create two separate models. One model will belong to the other. Each model should have a minimum of 6 attributes.
2 RESTful routes (index/show/edit/etc) for the parent model.
3 Views for all of the restful routes (CRUD).
4 Controller actions for the restful routes (CRUD).
5 Each attribute in your models should have validations.
6 Add bootstrap to your app! Try adding a basic navbar and some basic styling with the grid system.
